### Metrics -- Metrics infrastructure for OCaml

Metrics provides a basic infrastructure to monitor and gather runtime
metrics for OCaml program. Monitoring is performed on sources, indexed
by tags, allowing users to enable or disable at runtime the gathering
of data-points. As disabled metric sources have a low runtime cost
(only a closure allocation), the library is designed to instrument
production systems.

Metric reporting is decoupled from monitoring and is handled by a
custom reporter. A few reporters are (will be) provided by default.

Metrics is heavily inspired by
[Logs](http://erratique.ch/software/logs).


## Installation

Metrics can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install metrics

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`odoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][5].
